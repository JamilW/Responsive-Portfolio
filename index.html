                    <p id="p">I was born in Fayetteville, NC. Both of my parents are now retired. My father was a Superior Court judge (his most famous case he presided over was the death of Michael Jordan's father) and my mother was a civil engineer at Fort Bragg, NC. I have a twin sister, whom I am older by four minutes.</p>
                          <br>  
                    <p id="p">I love old school hip-hop music from the 90's (my favorite group is the Wu-Tang Clan). I also want to get into blogging about general pop culture and am a movie geek (love crime and courtroom dramas). I am interested in learning to code to find a career in web development.</p>
